defaultlogic
============

To my knowledge, the worlds only opensource default logic reasoner written in Java. If there are others please let me know. 
http://www.fnord.be.


Main launcher is  defaultlogic / src / main / java / be / fnord / DefaultLogic / App.java 

Both examples are documented in the class files 

    defaultlogic / src / main / java / be / fnord / DefaultLogic / AbductiveExample

    defaultlogic / src / main / java / be / fnord / DefaultLogic / DefaultLogicExample

* **Abductive Example**
> *Written by Evan Morrison, an abductive reasoner, will take in a knowledgebase, some possible actions effects (facts) and an observation. The reasoner will then find possible actions that could be performed together.*

* **Default Logic Example**
> *Written by Evan Morrison, a default logic reasoner based on Reiters Default logic, this is a lightweight and incomplete implementation of a default logic reasoner. No decision procedure has been documented for this tool and it will only produce results for a subset of default logic problems.*

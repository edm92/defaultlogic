No decision procedure has been documented for this tool and it will only produce results for a subset of default logic problems.*\r\n\r\n* **Abductive Example**\r\n> *Written by Evan Morrison, an abductive reasoner, will take in a knowledgebase, some possible actions effects (facts) and an observation. The reasoner will then find possible actions that could be performed together.*\r\n\r\n============\r\n\r\nThis tool is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License - as indicted in the License file.
